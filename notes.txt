What is UNIX?
-------------

It is an Operating system created in 1960's.

with lot of extensions and improvements to base version, several falvours introduced by organisations/companies (RedHat Linux, Ubuntu, Suse....)

Chracterstics of UNIX:
----------------------
1. It is Freeware
2. It is Open source software
   It is FOSS(Freeware and Open source Software)
3. It is multi user operating system
4. Is is multi tasking operating system
5. It is user friendly and supports both cui based and gui based
   CUI===>Chracter user interface
   GUI===>Graphical user interface
6. It is more secure than windows operating system

Flavours of UNIX:
-----------------
As UNIX is open source operating system, multiple flavours are available with lot of extension and improvements.

Ubuntu
RedHat Linux
CentOs
Fedora
Slackware
Open solaries
Kali
Suse Linux Enterprise Server(SLES)
Open Suse
POPOS

Components of UNIX:
-------------------
2 important Components
    Shell
    Kernel

1. shell:
---------
    * It is a OuterLayer of the unix operating system.
    * Shell read the command provided by user.
    * Shell will check whether is it valid command or not.
    * Shell will check whether is it properly used or not.
    * If everything is proper, then shell interprets/converts that command into kernel understandable form and handover that to the kernel.
    * Shell Acts as interfce between user and kernel. 

2. Kernel:
----------
    * It is the core component of UNIX operating system.
    * It is responsible to execute our command with the help of hardware components.
    * Memory allocation and processor allocation will take care by kernel.
    * It acts as interface between shell and hardware components.

To do a big task
-----------------
multiple commands


command Execution Flow:
-----------------------

normal user ===> $ prompt
super user/root user/admin user ===> # prompt


sudo -i ===> To Switch to super user
Exit ===> Logout

Online UNIX Terminal:

The most commonly used basic commands:
--------------------------------------
1. pwd --> print working directory.
2. ls --> list out all files and directories.
3. mkdir --> To create/make a directory.
4. cd ---> Change directory.
5. touch ---> To create an empty file.
6. rmdir ---> To remove a directory.
7. rm ---> To remove a file.
8. cal ---> Display current Month calendar.
9. date ---> Display Current date and time.
10. help ---> To Display list of available commands.
11. clear ---> to clear Terminal.
12. exit ---> To logout session.

Topic-2: Linux File system
--------------------------

Types of files in Linux:
------------------------
In python everything is treated as an object.
In Linux everything is treated as a file

1. Normal files or ordinary files
2. Directory files
3. Devices Files 


1. Normal files or ordinary files :
-----------------------------------

These files contain data. It can be normal text file or binary files(images, video, audio files)

abc.txt
test.sh ===> Script File
test.py ===> Python File
test.java ===> Java File
index.jpg
video.mp4


In Linux file extension is not important. based on our content the linux can identify file type.

2. Directory Files :
--------------------
These files represents directories
In windows, we can use folder terminology but in linux we can use directory terminology.
directory contains files and subdirectories also.


3. Device file :
----------------
In Linux every device is represent as a file
By using that file we can communicate with device.
Inside /dev directory all device related files will be there.

terminal ===> file
terminal 1 ===> /dev/pts/0
terminal 2 ===> /dev/pts/1

Note:
ctrl+alt+t ===> To open terminal
ctrl+d ====> To Close the terminal

How to Check file type :
------------------------
IN Ubuntu
blue colour files represent: directories remaining: ordinary file
