    * Shell read the command provided by user.
    * Shell will check whether is it valid command or not.
    * Shell will check whether is it properly used or not.
    * If everything is proper, then shell interprets/converts that command into kernel understandable form and handover that to the kernel.
    * Shell Acts as interfce between user and kernel. 

2. Kernel:
----------
    * It is the core component of UNIX operating system.
    * It is responsible to execute our command with the help of hardware components.
    * Memory allocation and processor allocation will take care by kernel.
    * It acts as interface between shell and hardware components.
